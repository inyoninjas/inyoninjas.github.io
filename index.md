Inyo is a scriptable (AppleScript) dialog utility optimized for high-visibility messaging and data entry. Inyo's display is a full-screen, modal "overlay" that requires you to intentionally acknowledge notifications or requests for input (hence "in yo' face" - btw, [icon = inyo](#icon)). Example use cases:  

* full screen notification
* prompt for field input
* I/O for a custom workflow
* pop an external webpage
* kiosk mode (with text and input fields formatted large)

Formatting can range from simple plain text, to markdown or full html. If you have used the awesome [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), this is essentially "Large Type", with **all** the bells and whistles.
