# Tell us what you think
At one level, Inyo has simply been an exercise in building an app, along with all the surrounding tasks. And at another level, it was just about building a tool that we wanted specifically for our own workflow escapades. That said, we hope there is some interest out there to use it. It's pretty cool - the quesiton is... are there a bunch of you out there that want to use it in similar, or even radically different ways. Some questions. Is it useful? Did we deliver functionality that makes sense? Are there other things you would like it to do? What is missing? Where could it go from here?
